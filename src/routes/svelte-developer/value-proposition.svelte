        Why This Journey Matters
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4">
        What sets me apart isn't just my technical expertise with Svelte â€“ it's understanding
        that great code comes from developers who enjoy their craft. Having led teams through
        this journey, I've seen how the right tools and approaches can transform not just
        codebases, but the entire development experience.
